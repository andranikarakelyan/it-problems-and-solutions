# IT Problems and Solutions

This repository contains a collection of IT problems I have encountered in my career or found personally interesting.
All solutions are **implemented manually** — no AI is used to generate the code itself.
AI may only be used for **documentation purposes** (such as code comments, explanations, or README files).

## Goals

* Practice and improve problem-solving skills.
* Document solutions for future reference.
* Showcase my coding abilities with clear, manual implementations.

## Rules

* 🚫 No AI-generated code is allowed.
* ✅ AI can be used for documentation, explanations, or code comments.
* 📝 Each solution should be clear, maintainable, and well-documented.

## Structure

Each problem will be placed in its own folder with a short description and solution code.
Documentation may include explanations, notes, or alternative approaches.

## Subprojects

* [Data Deduplication](data-deduplication/README.md) – Microservice to find duplicate titles and descriptions in internal website links.
